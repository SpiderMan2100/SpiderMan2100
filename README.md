- 👋 Hi, I’m @SpiderMan2100
- 👀 I’m interested in a career change. Transitioning out of theatrical management into the tech sector.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, after I've spent time studying Basic & Intermediate JavaScript, CSS, HTML, C#.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that allow creative solutions and learning opportunities.
- 📫 How to reach me? I feel like you should probably know how. It's a whole thing here, right?
